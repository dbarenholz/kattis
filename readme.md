# Kattis Solutions

This repository contains my Kattis solutions. I'm working through all the problems, sorted from easy to hard.

I am doing this to learn a little bit about C++.

## Snippets

In this directory you can find various snippets that I've found I had to do multiple times. I can use these to save time
when coding solutions.

## Problems

In this directory you can find my solutions. To run a particular solution, copy the file to the root directory, and
rename it to `_working.cc`. This is the file that will be run.
