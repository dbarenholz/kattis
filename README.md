# Kattis Solutions

This repository contains my Kattis solutions. I'm working through all the problems, sorted from easy to hard.

I am doing this to learn a little bit about C++.

## Snippets

In this directory you can find various snippets of code for particular tasks that I've found I had to do multiple times.
I can use these to save time when coding solutions.

## Problems

In this directory you can find my solutions. To run a particular solution:

1. Assuming you're in vs-code: Press `CTRL+SHIFT+B` to build.
2. The problem compiles to `./build/Kattis`, and can be run from there.
